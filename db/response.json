Also, the increasing number of launches of advanced diagnostic tools and rising research activities to provide effective therapeutics are further driving the growth of the market. However, factors such as a counterfeit antimalarial drug and subsequent drug resistance are restraining the market growth. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), malaria is an acute febrile illness caused by plasmodium parasites, which spread through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Malaria is caused by five parasite species in humans, and two of these species-Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax-pose the greatest threat. P. falciparum is the deadliest malarial parasite, and it is the most widespread one on the African continent. P. vivax is the dominant malarial parasite in most countries outside of sub-Saharan Africa. According to the World malaria report (WMR) 2020 by the WHO, 241 million cases of malaria were reported in 2020, compared to 227 million cases recorded in 2019. The number of deaths caused due to malaria reached 0.62 million in 2020, with an annual rise of 69,000 deaths. While approximately two-thirds of these deaths (47,000) were due to disruptions in healthcare services during the COVID-19 pandemic, the remaining one-third of deaths (22,000) reflected a recent change in WHO's methodology for calculating malaria mortality (irrespective of COVID-19 disruptions). As per the WHO, Africa continues to account for a disproportionately high share of the global burden of malaria. In 2020, 95% of the global cases of malaria and 96% of deaths were reported in Africa; ~80% of the total deaths caused by malaria are reported in children below 5 years of age. Four African countries-Nigeria (31.9%), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (13.2%), the United Republic of Tanzania (4.1%), and Mozambique (3.8%)-accounted for nearly half of all malaria-related deaths reported worldwide. According to the LANCET Regional Health 2020, the burden of malaria is the highest in African countries (95%); P. falciparum is the cause of the brunt of mortality in children younger than 5 (?77%) across the world, and in African countries, this species accounts for ?96% of total mortalities caused among children by malaria. Furthermore, P. vivax has been a causal agent of 2% (4.5 million) of the total cases, mostly from Asia. According to WMR 2021, ?2% of the global burden of malaria is borne by Southeast Asian countries, and India contributed 83% of estimated malaria cases and 82% of malaria deaths in Southeast Asia in 2020. Hence, the rising prevalence of malaria in different regions of the world boosts the malaria treatment market growth.
